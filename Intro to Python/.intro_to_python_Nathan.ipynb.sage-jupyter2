For example, if we find that we frequently have to get a random number, instead of coding it every time, you could just import a function that either you or someone else created in the past. Basically, modules and importing lets us have access to the work of many other coders, making it a very powerful tool.","metadata":{"id":"DoBzshOfQPSS"},"pos":74,"type":"cell"}
