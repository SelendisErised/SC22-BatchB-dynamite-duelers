For while loops, we can't specify how long they will run for ahead of time so its important for us to create an achievable exit condition. An exit condition is just the condition that will cause the code to stop running. This is checked every time, immediatly before the code runs or reruns. We want to make sure that this condition will eventually happen, otherwise the code will run until something crashes or we manually close it","metadata":{"id":"DpD_UkYBQPSN"},"pos":39,"type":"cell"}

Modules let us use functions that other people have created to solve problems that we commonly incounter. For example, if we find that we frequently have to get a random number, instead of coding it every time, you could just import a function that either you or someone else created in the past. Basically, modules and importing lets us have access to the work of many other coders, making it a very powerful tool.","metadata":{"id":"DoBzshOfQPSS"},"pos":73,"type":"cell"}
